## 🧠 Overview

This project focuses on ensuring safe and autonomous lunar landings by combining high-resolution terrain analysis with AI-driven decision making. Using Chandrayaan-2 OHRC imagery, the system:
- Detects terrain hazards via YOLOv8
- Trains a PPO-based reinforcement learning agent
- Identifies the safest landing zones based on terrain flatness, obstacle density, and proximity to hazards

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze lunar surface using high-res OHRC imagery
- Detect craters, rocks, and ridges using YOLOv8
- Apply Reinforcement Learning (PPO) to select safe landing coordinates
- Replace low-res Apollo-era data with Chandrayaan-2 data for improved accuracy
